			<b>User Interface Design:</b><br>
			Challenge: Designing a user-friendly and visually appealing interface using AWT and Swing.
			Solution: Consider using layout managers effectively, grouping related components, and providing clear labels for better user interaction.
			<br>
			<b>Code Structure and Readability:</b><br>
			Challenge: The code is currently written in a monolithic style, making it challenging to understand and maintain.
			Solution: Break down the code into smaller methods and classes, following principles of modularity and readability. This makes it easier to comprehend and maintain.
			<br>
			<b>Event Handling:</b><br>
			Challenge: Handling various user actions (button clicks, table selections) and updating the interface accordingly.
			Solution: Implement the ActionListener interface appropriately. Consider using separate methods for different functionalities to enhance clarity.
